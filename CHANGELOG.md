## [0.0.1] - Pre-Alpha [8/19/19] - [current]

### To-do list:
- ~~Allow the Carousel to include more than just Images. Full Widget support would be ideal.~~ [8/21/19]
- ~~Allow Carousel items to be clicked via an InkWell by default. Without this functionality, a carousel is just a fancy tab scroll bar.~~ [8/21/19]
- ~~Develop some complex examples for the package~~ [8/22/19]
- Let users be able to swipe over items in the Carousel in order to move it. It currently gets stuck.
- Prevent tapping on items in the carousel that are too far away
- Customize the shape and size of the carousel
- Introduce more customization to individual items on the carousel
